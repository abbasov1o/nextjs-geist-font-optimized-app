# How to Create a Private GitHub Repository and Push Your Local Project

## Step 1: Create a Private Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
2. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., `android-tiktok-downloader`).
4. Select **Private** for repository visibility.
5. (Optional) Add a description.
6. Do **NOT** initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since you already have these locally).
7. Click **Create repository**.

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/android-tiktok-downloader
   ```
2. Add the remote repository URL (replace `<your-github-username>` and `<repo-name>` with your info):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
3. Push your local commits to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 3: Verify

- Go to your GitHub repository page and refresh.
- You should see all your project files uploaded.
